	<p><em>Malaria Journal</em> is aimed at the scientific community interested in malaria in its broadest sense. It is the only journal that publishes exclusively articles on malaria and, as such, it aims to bring together knowledge from the different specialties involved in this very broad discipline, from the bench to the bedside and to the field. <em>Malaria Journal</em> offers a fast publication schedule while maintaining rigorous peer-review; this is achieved by managing the whole of the publication process electronically, from submission to peer-review.</p>
	
	<p><h3>Content Overview</h3></p>
	<p><em>Malaria Journal</em> considers the following types of articles:</p>
	  <ul class=list>
	  <li><strong>Research:</strong> <em>Malaria Journal</em> publishes primary research articles from the full spectrum of malaria research. Subjects covered include any aspects of the biology of malaria parasites and their vectors; clinical features and disease pathophysiology; biochemistry and molecular biology; case management and treatment; drug development and drug resistance; immunology, immunogenetics and vaccine development; genomes and transcriptomes of malaria parasites and their vectors; epidemiology and transmission dynamics; vector control; health system, policy and planning issues relating to prevention and treatment; economic, sociological and anthropological issues; poverty and gender issues, land use and global environmental change; intersectoral issues; intervention studies and operational research; control policy and planning.</li>
	  <li><strong>Case Reports: </strong><em>Malaria Journal</em> welcomes well-described reports of cases that can be used for educational purposes or that describe unusual features of the disease, its treatment, transmission or control. When describing clinical cases, the authors are requested to provide written and signed consent to publish the information from the patients or their guardians; case reports may include clinical pictures.</li> 
	  <li><strong>Case Studies:</strong> <em>Malaria Journal</em> welcomes well-described case study articles. These will usually describe a major health care intervention, usually from a public health perspective. Case study articles that include a rigorous assessment of the processes and impact of the intervention as well as recommendations for future interventions will be considered favourably. Note that Case study articles should not describe an individual patient - authors should use the case report format for such descriptions.</li>
	  <li><strong>Commentaries:</strong>
	  short, focused and opinionated articles on any subject within the journal's scope. These articles are usually related to a contemporary issue, such as recent research findings. They focus on specific issues and are about 800 words.
	  <li><strong>Methodology articles:</strong> Methodology articles should present a new experimental method, test or procedure. The method described may either be completely new, or may offer a better version of an existing method, or compare different methods currently in use. </li> 
	  <li><strong>Reviews:</strong> <em>Malaria Journal</em> aims to provide reviews with an in-depth coverage of all aspects of malaria. Some reviews are commissioned, but unsolicited reviews are welcome and are routinely peer-reviewed. Although reviews need not follow the same format as research articles, and are not limited in their length, they are nevertheless expected to conform to the overall house-style of the journal.</li> 
	  <li><strong>Opinion articles:</strong> These are short, opinionated, narrowly focused articles on issues of contemporary interest, including reports about meetings or viewpoints on recently published articles relevant to the readers of <em>Malaria Journal</em>. Some opinion articles are commissioned by the journal, but unsolicited commentaries are welcome and are routinely peer-reviewed. In addition, readers are encouraged to critically discuss articles published in <em>Malaria Journal</em> by means of 'Comments', which will then remain associated with the article; all 'Comments' are moderated.</li>
