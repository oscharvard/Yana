Just a place for temporary notes during development:

Here are some sample working opensearch urls that Tom sent me (Reinhard):

http://osc.hul.harvard.edu/yana/opensearch/node/lorem%20type%3Aj_article%20category%3A3%20lorem

http://osc.hul.harvard.edu/yana/opensearch/node/textwrangler

They look a touch different than the dash urls, but I think I just
need to move the q paremter etc. out of the code and into the
configuration.
